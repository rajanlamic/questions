CSS/HTML
1. Write HTML and CSS as outer wrapper and inside two divs one in left and one in right.
2. If you get the height 400px of left div, why outer div height is 0px as both divs are floated?

3. How can you put the one div inside the centre of another div where height of inner div is not known?

4. Write a JS function which has one one public property and one public method where public method returns the property.
function myFunc() {
    this.myProp = 'myVal';

    this.myMeth = function() {
        return this.myProp;
    }
}

var myObj = new myFunc();
myObj.getMeth(); // myVal

5. If added following

window.myProp = 'globalProp';
var f = myObj.myMeth;
f();

what does f returns?
what does f() returns? // globalProp

if you want to avoid returing gloablProp what should you do? self = this?

6. Have you used react? isomorphic react?

7. Write a function which extends myFunc and have own method.

function childFunc = function() {

}

childFunc.prototype = myObj;

childFunc.prototype.cldMeth = function() {

}

8. What is your preferance between bootstrap and your own custom css and why?

9. Do you use media query in bootstrap? or class will help you to pick according to the device?

10. Do you use any framework concept as BEM? and why u did not use it? was that as css selector and specificity?
