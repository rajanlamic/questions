What is Agile?
Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project,
instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.

It works by breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called user stories, prioritizing them,
and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called iterations.
