Kanban is based on 3 basic principles:
Visualize what you do today (workflow): seeing all the items in context of each other can be very informative
Limit the amount of work in progress (WIP): this helps balance the flow-based approach so teams dont start and commit to too much work at once
Enhance flow: when something is finished, the next highest thing from the backlog is pulled into play
