1. What is the difference between display:none and visibility:hidden

display:none will not be available in the page and does not occupy any space. visibility:hidden hides an element,
but it will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout.
visibility:hidden preserve the space, whereas display:none doesn't preserve the space
